### 1.5.5 CTL formula generator
* Added CTL formula generator
### 1.5.4 Created light/dark mode button for graph
* Clicking the button inverts the graph colors for all graphs
### 1.5.3 Added hints to buttons that refer you to tutorials
* Also uploaded corresponding video tutorials to youtube.com/@LogiVis
### 1.5.2 Initial publication improvements
* Made `.jar` buildable with one single command
* Replaced application entry points with a single one
  * What is run is now defined by program arguments
* Slightly adapted READMEs
